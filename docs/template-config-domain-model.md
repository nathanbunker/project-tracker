# Template Config — Domain Model and Schedule Pattern Reference

## Purpose

The `action_next_template_config` table stores per-template configuration for **recurring action generation**.
It is a satellite table to `action_next`, keyed on the same `action_next_id` as the template row.

This table separates generation-control metadata from the core action fields so that the base `action_next`
record remains unchanged regardless of whether auto-generation is enabled.

## Data Model

### Database

Migration: `src/db/v5.2.sql`

Table: `action_next_template_config`

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action_next_id` | int (PK, FK) | — | References `action_next.action_next_id`, cascades on delete |
| `auto_generate` | char(1) | `Y` | Whether the scheduler should generate instances (`Y`/`N`) |
| `missed_action_behavior` | varchar(16) | `AUTO_CANCEL` | How to handle a generated instance that was not completed |
| `schedule_days_of_week` | varchar(30) | NULL | Active days pattern for Weekly templates |
| `schedule_days_of_month` | varchar(100) | NULL | Active days pattern for Monthly templates |
| `schedule_days_of_quarter` | varchar(200) | NULL | Active days pattern for Quarterly templates |
| `schedule_days_of_year` | varchar(400) | NULL | Active days pattern for Yearly templates |
| `last_generated_date` | date | NULL | Date through which instances were last generated (set by scheduler) |

The `action_next` table also has a new column added by this migration:

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reschedule_locked` | char(1) | `N` | When `Y`, the scheduler will not move the generated instance to a later date |

### Hibernate / Model Mapping

- Class: `org.openimmunizationsoftware.pt.model.ActionNextTemplateConfig`
- Mapping: `ActionNextTemplateConfig.hbm.xml`
- Generator: `assigned` (PK is set by the caller, not auto-incremented)
- Boolean fields use `yes_no` type (`Y`/`N` char storage)

### Row Lifecycle

- A config row is created or upserted whenever a template is saved via `PlanAheadMutationService.saveTemplateEdit()`.
- Existing templates without a config row inherit defaults: `auto_generate=Y`, `missed_action_behavior=AUTO_CANCEL`.
- Deleting the template (`action_next` row) cascades to delete the config row automatically.

---

## `missed_action_behavior` Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AUTO_CANCEL` | The generated instance is marked cancelled if not completed by the end of the day (default) |
| `CARRY_FORWARD` | The generated instance is moved to the next working day if not completed |
| `IGNORE` | The generated instance is left as-is (appears as late/overdue until manually resolved) |

---

## `schedule_days_of_*` Pattern Reference

These fields control **which days within the recurrence period** a generated instance should be created.
They are only relevant when `auto_generate = Y`.

A `NULL` or empty value means **every applicable day** within the period fires (subject to working-day rules).

The `template_type` on `action_next` (`D`/`W`/`M`/`Q`/`Y`) determines which schedule field is active.
Daily templates (`D`) have no schedule field — generation fires on every working day by definition.

### Weekly (`schedule_days_of_week`)

Comma-separated day abbreviations.

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MON` | Every Monday |
| `MON,WED,FRI` | Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday |
| `TUE,THU` | Every Tuesday and Thursday |

Valid tokens: `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`, `SUN`

---

### Monthly (`schedule_days_of_month`)

Two formats may be combined in a comma-separated list.

**Format A — Calendar day number:**

The numeric day of the month.

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1` | 1st of the month |
| `1,15` | 1st and 15th |
| `28` | 28th (or last day if month is shorter) |

**Format B — Week-position day:**

`W{week}-{day}` where `{week}` is `1`–`5` or `L` (last), and `{day}` is a day abbreviation.

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `W1-MON` | First Monday of the month |
| `W2-FRI` | Second Friday of the month |
| `WL-FRI` | Last Friday of the month |
| `W1-MON,WL-FRI` | First Monday and last Friday |

---

### Quarterly (`schedule_days_of_quarter`)

Two formats, same logic as monthly but counted within the quarter (90–92 days).

**Format A — Calendar day of the quarter:**

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1` | First day of the quarter |
| `46` | 46th day of the quarter (mid-quarter) |
| `1,46,91` | First day, mid-quarter, and near end |

**Format B — Week-position day:**

`W{week}-{day}` where `{week}` is `1`–`13` or `L` (last week of the quarter).

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `W1-MON` | First Monday of the quarter |
| `W7-WED` | Wednesday of the 7th week of the quarter |
| `W13-FRI` | Friday of the 13th week of the quarter |
| `WL-FRI` | Last Friday of the quarter |
| `W1-MON,W13-FRI` | First Monday and last Friday of each quarter |

---

### Yearly (`schedule_days_of_year`)

Two formats, same logic as monthly but within the year.

**Format A — MMDD date:**

Four-digit string `MMDD` (no separator).

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0101` | January 1st |
| `1225` | December 25th |
| `0101,0701,1225` | January 1st, July 1st, and December 25th |

**Format B — Month + week-position day:**

`{MON}-W{week}-{day}` where `{MON}` is a three-letter month abbreviation.

| Example | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `JAN-W1-MON` | First Monday of January |
| `DEC-WL-FRI` | Last Friday of December |
| `MAR-W1-MON,JUN-WL-FRI` | First Monday of March and last Friday of June |

Valid month tokens: `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, `APR`, `MAY`, `JUN`, `JUL`, `AUG`, `SEP`, `OCT`, `NOV`, `DEC`

## Interaction with `reschedule_locked`

`reschedule_locked` is a column on `action_next` (not on the config table). It applies to **generated instances**, not to the template itself.

When the scheduler generates an instance and `missed_action_behavior = AUTO_CANCEL`, the generated instance
is created with `reschedule_locked = Y`. This signals to the rescheduler that the instance should not be
pushed to a future date — it should be cancelled instead.

For `CARRY_FORWARD` behavior, generated instances are created with `reschedule_locked = N` so the
rescheduler is free to move them forward.

---

## Phase Notes

**Phase 1 (current)** implements the schema, model, and template edit form only.

- Schedule fields are stored and retrieved but not yet evaluated by any generation logic.
- `last_generated_date` is stored in the schema but not written by any current code path.
- `reschedule_locked` is available on the model but only set to `N` by the default; no code path sets it to `Y` yet.

Auto-generation logic (reading schedule fields and creating instances) is reserved for Phase 2.
